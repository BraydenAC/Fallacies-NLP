# What is this project?
This is my final project for ARI-545: Natural Language Processing!
It is an interface created using visual basic and python that takes a given sentence, and checks it for fallacies.
If it detects a fallacy, it consults Llama 3.2 1b to get an explanation as to why it is that fallacy, and displays that explanation to the user.
Thanks for checking it out!

# How to use it.
- Download the project, then open it in any given api(created in VS Code)
- Download any dependencies you may need
- Open a new terminal, then type "dotnet run"
- Follow the given instructions in the interface
- Your good to go!
